Banknote Dataset
The Banknote Dataset involves predicting whether a given banknote is authentic given a number of measures taken from a photograph.

It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 1,372 observations with 4 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

Variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
Kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
Entropy of image (continuous).
Class (0 for authentic, 1 for inauthentic).
The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 50%.

Sonar Dataset
The Sonar Dataset involves the prediction of whether or not an object is a mine or a rock given the strength of sonar returns at different angles.

It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 208 observations with 60 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

Sonar returns at different angles
â€¦
Class (M for mine and R for rock)
The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 53%. Top results achieve a classification accuracy of approximately 88%.
